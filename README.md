# Rock Paper Scissors Game (JavaScript).

This application is fully responsive and is available on the web, built with JavaScript HTML and CSS3.

The classic rock-paper-scissors game allows the user to enter their name before starting the game and placed it on the scoreboard.

The game has retro-style background music that will change depending on which section of the application is active, and the user can increase or decrease its volume.

To start the game, the user must select one of the three animated characters on the screen. Selecting one of them will start the game and face a virtual player.

The central animation will show who beats whom and will take a count of games won or lost by each player and a count of the tied games.

The player will win when his score reaches five games won before the other competitor.

As soon as the winner is determined, the winner or game over screen appears depending on the obtained result.

On the winning player and game over screen, the user will have the option of playing again or quit the game.

If the user chooses the option to leave the game, the goodbye screen displays.
